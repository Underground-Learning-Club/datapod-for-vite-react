Wanted to run off some fat from the Christmas holidays, so at 4:30 decided to take 90 minutes, get out into the night and run. Tried to beat my 44 minute times but barely made it under 45 minutes. Ran hard but not in shape, after run weighed 88 kilos. I really need to get this down to at least a sensible 80 before the DCI run in April and the Copenhagen Marathon in May.
