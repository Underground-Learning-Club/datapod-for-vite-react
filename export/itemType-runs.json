Tried to beat my 44 minute times but barely made it under 45 minutes. Ran hard but not in shape, after run weighed 88 kilos. I really need to get this down to at least a sensible 80 before the DCI run in April and the Copenhagen Marathon in May.\n\n##33start\n\n##33out\n\n##33car\n\n##33hosp\n\n##33steps\n\n##33empty\n\n##33gas\n\n##33city\n\n##33nochcit\n\n##33noandci\n\n##33watch"
