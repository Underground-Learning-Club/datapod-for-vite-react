# Datapod-for-Vite-React CORE

**Datapod-for-Vite-React CORE** is an experimentation ground for new Datapod projects and it is the project that generates the Datapod for Vite React framework. This generation takes place by pressing a button after which the application makes a copy of itself, then initializes a process which deletes all unnecessary files which do not belong to the **Datapod for Vite React** project, and makes final tweaks to create a new version of **Datapod for Vite React** that is ready to download and use.

**Datapod for Vite React** is a light-weight, self-contained web framework with which you can create fast database-powered web applications with user login, self-validating forms, easy-to-create pages.

## Datapod

Datapod itself is a framework-agnostic, flexible and strongly-typed approach to data, a project I have been pursuing for over a decade in various languages and frameworks, here are some extant historical relics of some of my various Datapod projects:

- https://tanguay.info/datapod - the original idea of Datapod
- https://tanguay.info/dpwpf/screenshots.php - Datapod for WPF from 2009
- https://tanguay.info/dpphp_01000 - Datapod for PHP from 2011
- https://tanguay.info/dpphp - Datapod for PHP from 2014
- https://dpodreact.netlify.app - Datapod for React from 2021 
- https://github.com/edwardtanguay/n49901_dpn - Datapod for Node/Express from 2020

## online site

- there is currently no online site since current work is setting up basic database features such as **dpod syntax parsing** which I am using simple as a place to generate datapod functionality that I need for other projects

## team

- currently [Edward Tanguay](https://github.com/edwardtanguay) is the only developer of this project
- this is a project in the [Online Learning Club](https://github.com/Underground-Learning-Club)
- anyone is free to join

## project board

- find tasks here in the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/Underground-Learning-Club/projects/7/views/1)

## general plan

- the current plan for this project is to be a local Vite-React application with a backend in the same directory that allows the user to create pages, item types, etc. and save this data into a JSON file via json-server
- when you push this project to Vercel, it will automatically hide any admin pages, but read the data from the json files via import, hence giving you a read-only site at Vercel which you can manage via the website interface locally
